# 🐚 EchoCraft - Custom Python Shell

A POSIX-compliant shell built in Python, featuring a custom tokenizer, parser, and support for key shell functionalities like piping, redirection, and command history.

> ⚙️ **Originally inspired by the ["Build Your Own Shell" challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview) from [CodeCrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io)**. This project began as part of that challenge but has since evolved into a fully custom implementation.
